﻿Hello World by Malo Herve

# Welcome to the Markdown List of commands
## Basics 

#### Italic
Use _ to make a sentence italic.

#### Bold
Use ** to make a sentence bold.  
Note : You can use both signs to make a sentence bold and italic.

#### Headers
Header size are defined by the number of # that precede them, 1 being the biggest and 6 the smallest.

## **Links**
You can embed links with 2 different ways.  
1) Inline link : write down [ Name of your link ]( html address ). This appears as [Try Me !!!](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Succesfully-Rick-Roll/) .  
2) Reference link : Use [ Name ][ Name of the marker ], then at the end of the document define [ Name of the Marker ] : html address. This appears [Get to git][link to git].

## **Images**
Similarly to Links there a 2 ways:  
1) Inline link : write down ! before the [  ].  
2) Reference link : Same as before, just precede it with ! .

## **Block Quotes**
Used to make quotes stand out. Just add > before the quote

## **Lists**
#### Unordered List
Preface each element with an * . This creates a bullet point list.

#### Ordered List

Preface each element with 1. .  
Note : You can have lists inside of lists. Just use indents.  

## **Paragraphs**
To make sure that two seperate lines in your code appear as two seperate lines in your rendered markdown, instead of adding an extra line between your two lines, add two spaces ate the end of your line. (called sof break)
